            <h3 class="third-title">Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Beat the eggs: </strong>In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper until they are well mixed. 
                You can add a tablespoon of water or milk for a fluffier texture.</li>
                <li><strong>Heat the pan: </strong>Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and add butter or oil.</li>
                <li><strong>Cook the omelette: </strong>Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan to ensure the eggs evenly coat the surface.</li>
                <li><strong>dd fillings (optional): </strong>When the eggs begin to set at the edges but are still slightly runny in the middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings over one half of the omelette.</li>
                <li><strong>Fold and serve: </strong>As the omelette continues to cook, carefully lift one edge and fold it over the fillings. Let it cook for another minute, then slide it onto a plate.</li>
                <li><strong>Enjoy: </strong>Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed.</li>
            </ol>
